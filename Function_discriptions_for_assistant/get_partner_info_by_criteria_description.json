  "description": "Retrieves partner (contact) information based on the given criteria from the SK-Medical Odoo server. Use this function when associating the customer with an existing partner account in step 2. On successful connection to the Odoo server and at least one partner found, get_partner_info_by_criteria() returns a list of dictionaries with each element of the list corresponding to a partner. The dictionaries contain information on the partner's 'id' (use this value for the partner_id when creating an invoice), the name, email, phone, whether it is a company, and address information including street, city, and state_id. On successful connection to the Odoo server but no partners matching the criteria are found, get_partner_info_by_criteria() returns the string 'No partners found with the given criteria'. On failed connection to the Odoo server, get_partner_info_by_criteria() returns an error message.",
