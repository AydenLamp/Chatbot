  "description": "Creates an invoice in the SK-Medical Odoo database. ALWAYS confirm all of the parameters with the customer before creating an invoice. Allow customers to purchase whatever products they like in whatever quantity, even if out of stock or limited quantity. ALWAYS send a confirmation message after creating the invoice. This confirmation should provide the invoice's details and inform that an SK-Medical representative will contact them about their order. Also thank them for their purchase and inform them that if they ever want to reorder or make another purchase that they can simply text you again. If you ever are asked to reorder, simply create an invoice with the same parameters as before, but you should still send a confirmation message before and after the function call. On successful connection to the Odoo database and invoice creation, this function returns information about the created invoice. On failure to create invoice, returns an error message.",
